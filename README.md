# Object-Recognition-System
The object recognition project aims to develop a system capable of identifying objects in real-time using machine learning algorithms. This system will enable the identification of various objects captured by a laptop's camera.

You'll need to install the following packages through command prompt

Streamlit: For building the web-based interactive app.(pip install streamlit)
OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and computer vision tasks. (pip install opencv-python)
Torch (PyTorch): For machine learning and deep learning models. (pip install torch)
Pillow (PIL): For image processing (alternative to OpenCV for some tasks). (pip install pillow)
Numpy: For handling arrays and mathematical operations. (pip install numpy)
